DonationManagerCLI

## Running the application
To run the application we need to be inside it's directory

The application is a CLI, so for every command we want to execute we need to invoke it with the command we want to run, for example, to run the command help, we could do:

java -jar "dist/DonationsManager.jar" help

But to make things easier we created a .bat file to facilitate the process by allowing us to substitute **java -jar "dist/DonationsManager.jar"** by simply **don**. So to run the same command we did earlier we could simply run:

don help

with this explained you can now use it as intended, for the list of available commands refer to the help command.
